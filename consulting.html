        <h2>What do I value in Styling?</h2>
        <p>
          That it exudes value! A styling is most effective when it resonates immediately and effortlessly with the viewer. When working with me, you can count on a
          styling that radiates with true value. I aim to compose unerring looks that inspire the customers’ eyes, making the pieces shine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Staying one step ahead of today’s looks creates a lasting appeal - I am always delighted to be able to create new looks and compositions that attract with
          harmony, as well as an individual mood and singular details to fall in love with. However, no direction is foreign to me: hip & realistic, original & practical
          – make a wish!
